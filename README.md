This is the third beginner project I have completed.
The use of Set() is what makes this project more complex than the first two
In addition, the function generateQuote contains the meat of this project. Using two if statements: 
1 to clear the Set() after reaching maximum quotes used. 
2 to continue or break out the loop 
And the use of a while() loop to ensure a quote doesn't get repeated until all others are generated.
